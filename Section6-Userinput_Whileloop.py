##Section 6. User Input and While Loop

##Lecture 1. User Input -part A
#How the input() Function Works
message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)


#build a multi-line string for the prompt
prompt = "If you tell us who you are, we can personalize the messages you see."
prompt += "\nWhat is your first name? :  "


name = input(prompt)
print("\nHello, " + name + "!")



##Lecture 2. User Input -part B
#Using int() to Accept Numerical Input
height = input("How tall are you, in inches? ")
height = int(height)

if height >= 36:
    print("\nYou're tall enough to ride!")
else:
    print("\nYou'll be able to ride when you're a little older.")


#The Modulo Operator
number = input("Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd: ")
number = int(number)   #Using int() to Accept Numerical Input

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("\nThe number " + str(number) + " is even.")
else:
    print("\nThe number " + str(number) + " is odd.")



##Lecture 3. Introducing while Loops-A
#loop counts from 1 to 5:
current_number = 1
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1


#Letting the User Choose When to Quit
prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "

message = ""
while message != 'quit':
    message = input(prompt)
    print(message)

#Does not show message when user input 'quit'
prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "

message = ""
while message != 'quit':
    message = input(prompt)
    if message != 'quit':    #if input is quit, does not show this before quit
        print(message)



#Using a Flag
prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "
  
active = True
while active:
    message = input(prompt)
    
    if message == 'quit':
        active = False
    else:
        print(message)





#Lecture 4.Using break and continue in while loops
#Using break to Exit a Loop
prompt = "\nPlease tell me a city you have visited:"
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.) "

while True:
    city = input(prompt)
    
    if city == 'quit':
        break
    else:
        print("I'd love to go to " + city.title() + "!")
        


#Using continue in a Loop
current_number = 0
while current_number < 10:
    current_number += 1
    if current_number % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(current_number)



##Lecture 5 Using a while Loop with Lists
#Moving Items from One List to Another
# Start out with some users that need to be verified,
#  and an empty list to hold confirmed users.
unconfirmed_users = ['alice', 'brian', 'candace']
confirmed_users = []

# Verify each user, until there are no more unconfirmed users.
#  Move each verified user into the list of confirmed users.
while unconfirmed_users:
    current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop()
    
    print("Verifying user: " + current_user.title())
    confirmed_users.append(current_user)
    
# Display all confirmed users.
print("\nThe following users have been confirmed:")
for confirmed_user in confirmed_users:
    print(confirmed_user.title())
    
    
    
#Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List
pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']
print(pets)

while 'cat' in pets:
    pets.remove('cat')
    
print(pets)









##Lecture 6. Using a while Loop with Dictionaries
#Filling a Dictionary with User Input
responses = {}

# Set a flag to indicate that polling is active.
polling_active = True

while polling_active:
    # Prompt for the person's name and response.
    name = input("\nWhat is your name? ")
    response = input("Which mountain would you like to climb someday? ")
    
    # Store the response in the dictionary:
    responses[name] = response
    
    # Find out if anyone else is going to take the poll.
    repeat = input("Would you like to let another person respond? (yes/ no) ")
    if repeat == 'no':
        polling_active = False
        
# Polling is complete. Show the results.
print("\n--- Poll Results ---")
for name, response in responses.items():
    print(name + " would like to climb " + response + ".")
