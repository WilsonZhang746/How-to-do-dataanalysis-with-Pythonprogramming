##Section 9. Files and Exceptions
##Lecture 1. Reading from a File
#Reading an Entire File
#opens file pi_digits.txt, reads it, and prints the contents
#of the file to the screen:
with open('pi_digits.txt') as file_object:
     contents = file_object.read()
     print(contents.rstrip())
     
#use a relative file path
with open('test\\pi_digits.txt') as file_object:
    contents = file_object.read()
    print(contents.rstrip())
    
#use an absolute file path 
file_path = 'd:\\test\\pi_digits.txt'
with open(file_path) as file_object:
    contents = file_object.read()
    print(contents.rstrip())

    
#Reading Line by Line
#Reading Line by Line    
filename = 'pi_digits.txt'
with open(filename) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line)

    
#remove extra blank lines
filename = 'pi_digits.txt'
with open(filename) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line.rstrip()) 

    
#Making a List of Lines from a File

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

for line in lines:
    print(line.rstrip())  
    

#Working with a Fileâ€™s Contents
filename = 'pi_digits.txt'
with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

pi_string = ''
for line in lines:
    pi_string += line.rstrip()

print(pi_string)
print(len(pi_string))



#get rid of whitespace at the left side of digits

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

pi_string = ''
for line in lines:
    pi_string += line.strip()    #use strip here 

print(pi_string)

#Large Files: One Million Digits
#print just the first 50 decimal places

    print("Your birthday appears in the first million digits of pi!")
else:
    print("Your birthday does not appear in the first million digits of pi.")


    
    



##Lecture 2. Writing to a File
#Writing to an Empty File
filename = 'programming.txt'

with open(filename, 'w') as file_object:
    file_object.write("I love programming")
    
    
#Writing Multiple Lines
filename = 'programming.txt'

with open(filename, 'w') as file_object:
    file_object.write("I love programming.\n")
    file_object.write("I love creating new games.\n")
    

#Appending to a File
filename = 'programming.txt'

with open(filename, 'a') as file_object:
    file_object.write("I also love finding meaning in large datasets.\n")
    file_object.write("I love creating apps that can run in a browser.\n")







##Lecture 3. Using try-except Blocks Exception
#Handling zero-division error
print(5/0)

try:
    print(5/0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
    
    
#Using Exceptions to Prevent Crashes
print("Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.")
print("Enter 'q' to quit.")

#a loop never stopped unless with q
while True:
    first_number = input("\nFirst number: ")
    if first_number == 'q':
        break
    second_number = input("Second number: ")
    try:
        answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("You can't divide by 0!")
    else:
        print(answer)
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
##Lecture 4. Handling the FileNotFoundError Exception
#try to open and read a file which has not been saved in the
#current working directory
#FileNotFoundError
